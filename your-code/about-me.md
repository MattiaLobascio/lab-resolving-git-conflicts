NEW BRANCH - MODIFIED TO PROVOKE A CONFLICT, FIXED AFTERWARDS ----

# Who am I

* Where are you from?

<<<<<<< HEAD
My name is Mattia Lobascio and I am 28.

I am from Italy, but currently living in Lisbon.

* What do you do?

Currently I am unemployed. I graduated in Finance and Econmics in 2016 in Italy and worked there for 2 years, first in Insurace and then in Investments in Real Estate. I then took a master here in Lisbon in Sustainable Energy Systems at TÃ©cnico, to shift my carrer path towards investments in renewable energies and clean technologies able to create a positive social impact, which I found in an Investment Advisory firm in Milan again from January 2019 till April 2019. Meanwhile, from August 2018 till September 2019 I started a company named "Urban Food Box", together with some former colleagues of my master here in Lisbon. The goal was to develop a software technology able to optimize the energy performance of large commercial buildings while recycling the otherwise wasted electrcal and thermal enenergy as input for a controlled environment agriculture chamber integrated inside the building itself. Basically producing food on-site from currently wasted resources of urban areas. I left my previous job in Italy in April to move again here in Lisbon after our project was accepted in Maze-X startup accelaerator and then funded by Gulbenkain. I unfortunately had to leave the company in August as a consequence of serious divergences of views on managment with one of the other founders.       

* Do you have previous experience with technology/data?

No, I have not been working strictly with data and technology. However, as financial analyst in Italy and even more along my entreprenurship experience I have been working a lot in building semi-automated finacial models in Excel in order to simulate investmens and business models scenarios and outcomes.
